- Test date formats: how many of them are implemented and working, which ones were a challenge and we could not make them work.

- Test cities and countries.

- Professions:
    - Dataset --> format
    - Old data --> format
    - Convert new data into old format
    - Is the new dataset more exhaustive?
    - ATENTION!: Something rather peculiar in the old dataset is that when the profession name comes together with some sort of 'detailed informatation/clarification' it is written between inverted commas. Ex: "AckompanjatÃ¶r, klassisk musik"
    
    - 3 columns: [line count, SSYK 2012 code, YrkesbenÃ¤mning]
    - Can we maybe (as an option) change the SSYK code (swedish) for the ISCO code (i think it was called like that in English)?
    - Does the new database include the ISCO code for each profession/job?
    
    

- Universities:
    - Find a list of the top 100 universities in the world maybe(?)
    - Make a list as in --> list_universities = ['______', '_______', ...]
